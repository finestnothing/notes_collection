- Stuff about bread yo
- Autolyze
	- Comes right after initial mixing of dough ingredients
	- Allows gluten development to start faster without kneading
	- 15 minutes to an hour of autolyze time depending on type of dough
		- For sourdough, minimum of 30 minutes
			- A full hour is best
- Rising time
	- Let rise around 68-70 degrees
	- Will take 3-12 hours depending on the dough and yeast vs sourdough
		- Rises faster as the temperature increases
		- Temperature controls time
	- Watch the dough, not the clock
		- Should double in size
- Strengthening the dough
	- About 30 minutes into rising time, stretch and rise the dough
		- Strengthens the dough and gluten
		- Helps have a taller rise
	- Can repeat every 15 - 60 minutes during rising time
	- Entirely optional, but is worth it
- Stretch and fold
	- Grab a portion of the dough (e.g. grab in two places at top)
	- Pull up, stretch, and fold down close to the middle of the dough
	- Rotate bowl 90 degrees
	- Repeat until 4 stretches complete
