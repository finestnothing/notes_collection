# Don't Make Notes Categories
Created: 2022-06-09 08:04

You shouldn't aim for creating categories for fitting notes into. Doing this makes it very hard to adapt, and if a note doesn't fit into a category nicely then you are forced to either put it in one badly, or create a new niche category. You also will have issues with possibly forgetting or losing relevant information if it's in a different category.

The benefit of Zettelkasten is that it isn't just a bunch of well organized knowledge, it's meant to emulate a brain where ideas are connected rather than categorized. There isn't a specific system that's needed, and you can adapt it to your own brain and how you think to make it work even better for you.

To work on Zettelkasten, there will be a lot of growing pains at first - just like a newborn learning, or learning a new language. 

You treat your Zettelkasten like you learn. You collect information [[fleeting_notes]], then you digest it at a later time [[literature_notes]]. Finally, you connect the digested information [[literature_notes]] to other related information in [[permanent_notes]] and [[content_maps]].

As you get more information, you can grow your "web", either stemming from each [[content_maps]] directly, or they can branch out and more resemble a spider web as notes connect to each other.

Naturally, categories will form while doing this. Whether it's two content maps sharing information, clusters around certain tags, or anything else, it gets easier to incorporate additional information as needed.
