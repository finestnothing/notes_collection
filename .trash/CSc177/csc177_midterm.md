Got some answers from Justin, mainly confirmed the answers that I already had, only had a change a few which was great.
Submitting it today [2022-04-01](../../Daily_Notes/2022-04-01.md) (cause it's due today)
Lost 12 points from already graded questions, but I feel good about the short answer so I should get a B. May get some points back, but not sure.
