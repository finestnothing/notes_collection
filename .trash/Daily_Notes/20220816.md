## Notes

## Work
- Initial training, continuing [[20220817]]
- Data lake
	- Started last year
	- Idea for tech is to be your own CEO (run and own your section)
	- Danny and David Woodmark made data lake
		- Hired contractors and all worked together to build bones of data lake
	- Very overbuilt, but not bad
	- Biggest goal is get data as live as possible (lowest latency)
		- Data reporting gets data to warehouse within 5-10 minutes, run etls every 20 minutes, 5-10 minutes to run the etls
		- Reporting has 10 minutes of latency now
			- Will be lower latency after current roll out
				- Build takes 2-3 mins
- Ditching builds on 800 column tables, just make a view on the base data
	- Exactly what they had before, but far faster 
	- Means they don't need to recopy the data, just looks at the base data
- Will be rebuilding other departments queries in databricks
- Devlynn Hoffman - Do NOT need to hit submit in ultipro as a salaried worker
	- Ultipro time management is only for PTO for me
