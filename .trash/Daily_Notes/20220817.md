## Notes

## Work
- Done with useful training, today is just legal stuff. Last day at least.
- Data lake infrastructure
	- All of it lives in aws accounts
		- Separated by uses (production, front facing, automation tools, etc)
		- Databricks - all databases are all saved in s3 buckets
		- All data gets added to them (direct from ultipro, read from csv)
- Joined forces with Deloitte a few years ago
	- Deloitte got all non-US immigration, BAL gets all US immigrations
	- Deloitte has a mirror of our Cobalt code,  updates to cobalt is sent to them (data backend is different)
	- Data exchange w/ deloitte
		- Every 4 hours, read data from data warehouses, exchange, load in w/ databricks
- Ims is production database
	- Stream the data, only changes get sent, Kafka reads them 
	- Debesium and Kafka
		- Live in aws
		- Hard to access, way overbuilt but works very well
