# how_zettelkasten_grows

To work on Zettelkasten, there will be a lot of growing pains at first - just like a newborn learning, or learning a new language. This is fine, because it grows and morphs according to you, if you let it.

You treat your Zettelkasten like you learn.
You collect information in [[seedlings]] (aka fleeting notes), then you digest it at a later time into [[sprouts]] (aka literature notes).
Later, you break your [[sprouts]] into atomic notes, called [[mature]] notes (permanent notes).
As you create the mature notes, you should attempt to link topics in them, to be able to connect notes together.

As you get more information, you can grow your "web", either stemming from each [[garden]] (aka content map) directly, or they can branch out and more resemble a spider web as notes connect to each other. 

Zettelkastens are not supposed to be dropped into categories, just organically grown around topics and ideas (see [[why_categories_are_bad]])
