algorithms to live by chapter 3: Sorting
- Page 59
- Sorting is in everything, Google isn't so prevalent because it finds all relevant results - that part is easy. It's relevant because it is so good at showing the best results - by sorting all of the results
- Big-O notation is used for measuring algorithm speed
- Mainly just goes over different sorting algorithms, not very useful unfortunately
