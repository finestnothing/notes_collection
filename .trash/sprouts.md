These are the intermediate step between [[seedlings]] and [[mature]] notes.
They are fully written in your own words, but are *not* atomic.
You can combine multiple related [[seedlings]] into a single [[sprouts]] note.
The idea is to make them fully your own.
Add your own thoughts and ideas into the descriptions and notes rather than just paraphrasing the source.
They are later transformed into atomic [[mature]] notes
