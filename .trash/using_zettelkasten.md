# Using Zettelkasten

1. Take notes on something in the [[+about_inbox|inbox]]
	- These should not be in-depth notes, just the overall ideas that I think I want to explore more later
		- Okay to make them in-depth, but leave room for later interpretation
	- Okay to just use zettelkasten titling
	- Only meant to be temporary, can be deleted after being converted
2. At the end of the day/week/month/whenever I have time/tuesdays, go through the [[+about_inbox|inbox]]and upgrade the notes to the [[+about_dev|dev]] folder
	- Literature notes expand on the ideas from the fleeting notes, but it is okay to drop ideas that you no longer see as useful or helpful!
	- Literature notes still need the context of the original source in most cases
	- Should only rephrase ideas, not copy/paste them. Make them relevant to ME not the author
		- These should be my thoughts and ideas on the topics from the inbox
	- Keep the title of the source, to make it easier to reference
3. Eventually, go through [[+about_dev|dev]] to create [[+about_cards|cards]]
	- These will never get deleted, but it is okay to edit, add, and change them if you get more related content
	- Multiple permanent notes can come from one literature note and be linked together
		- Example: What is bootstrapping and Benefits of bootstrapping as different notes that are linked together
4. Make [[map_of_content]] for each major topic that refence relevant [[+about_cards|cards]]
