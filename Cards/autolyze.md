# autolyze
Created: 20221012 17:50

The autolyze portion is right after all the ingredients of bread have been incorporated, before kneading takes place.
This step makes the gluten stronger since it can develop without kneading softening it.
Autolyzing can range from 15 minutes to an hour, closer to an hour is usually best.
This is relevant for pretty much all breads.
