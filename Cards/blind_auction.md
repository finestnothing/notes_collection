- Everyone bids a set amount, highest bid wins
- Loop again
	- You have to anticipate what the other people see the item as worth so you can win, but save as much money as possible
	- They are doing the same
	- In both cases, you have to anticipate them anticipating you anticipating them anticipating you.... etc etc
- More likely to over pay for an item to try to get it, but also even the amount that you see it as worth is over paying if the next highest bid was significantly lower
