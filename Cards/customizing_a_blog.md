Created: 2022-09-29 18:43

- Customization is something I really look forward to when I make a blog
- Have to pick out a nice color scheme
	- Want something that isn't bland, but also isn't jarring to see
- Also need some static pages
	- About me
		- Passions, career, blog bio, etc
	- Contact info
	- These make it so I'm not just a faceless blog, humanizes me and my content
- Add comments sections so the community can participate
- Holiday changes/easter eggs in the website?
