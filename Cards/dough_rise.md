The dough rise portion should be done around 68-70 degrees
This is the optimal temperature for the gluten to develop and rise

Yeast usually rises faster than sourdough, overall it should take 2-12 hours
Rule of thumb is to wait until the dough has doubled in size (not applicable for all bread types)
