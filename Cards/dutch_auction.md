## Dutch Auction
- Descending auction
	- Price starts high and goes down bit by bit
	- First bidder gets it
- Better for the seller, worse for the buyers (bad for game theory)
- To win, you have to try to anticipate what the product is worth to the other bidders
	- At the same time, they are considering the same of you
	- Then you/they adjust the price they'll bid at to try to get it for the lowest price without someone else getting it
