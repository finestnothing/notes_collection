- Ascending auction (aka standard auction)
- Information cascade is common
	- You don't think you have the best information for what the item is worth, so you try to use other peoples bids to judge the value
	- At the same time, they are doing the same and using you as a source of information
	- Infinite loop here so people can get in bidding wars and way overpay
- Likely to over pay or not get the item
