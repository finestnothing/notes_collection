- Examples include paying CC bills, responding to emails, etc
- If you have 30 days to pay bills, pick one day a month to pay all your bills
- If you get emails and set a time frame of responding to emails within 15 minutes, respond to all emails every 10-15 minutes rather than as they come in
- If you have several weeks to respond to mail, only look through your email one day per week
