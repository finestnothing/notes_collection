# explore_exploit_interval
Created: 2022-06-16 09:20

- The interval is the total time that you have for a set of options
- Time in a city, your lifetime, 10 year goal, etc
- As you start the interval, exploring is the best option
	- As you get near the end of the interval (old, about to move, etc), it's best to exploit since you won't have time to exploit any new options
