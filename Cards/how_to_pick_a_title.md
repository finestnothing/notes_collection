# how_to_pick_a_title
Created: 2022-09-29 18:36

- [[post_titles_are_imporant]]
- Small words make titles more personal
	- E.G. MyBlog.com vs Blog.com
- The title should be relevant to the content
- Avoid clickbait - make the title an accurate reflection of what's going on inside, not a weird spin to try to lure people in for drama
