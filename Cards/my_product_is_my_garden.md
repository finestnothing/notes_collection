## Analogy

- My product is my garden - Software
	- Plants require maintenance (nurturing, weeding, etc) - Adding new features, bug fixes, etc
	- Requires research - New technologies, software, etc
	- What grows well near other plants - How your product works compared to others, what it complements, what features work well together

## Ideology

You should try to putter about on your project.
Spend time on it, have a good time doing it.
Do it because it's enjoyable!
Don't focus on the product for the sake of it growing, work on it to ensure it is useful to you and it's userbase and continually improving everyone's experience with them.
