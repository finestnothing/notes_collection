# Don't Be Spooky

Whenever asking someone to meet about something, make sure to include *why* you want to meet too.
Especially avoid sending meeting messages with no context before or after a meeting.

Why: even if it's not something they did wrong or some bad news, the other person doesn't know that.
Telling them what it is about also gives them a few seconds to put together anything they need to to be prepared for the call.

Don't send repeated pings either.
Even if you don't get a response in an hour or two, they are almost certainly still busy and pinging them again won't help either.
At most ping them every day or two just as a reminder, especially if they don't respond or give you a timeline.

Don't send a "hello" or other intro in it's own message.
Just send it with whatever message you were wanting to send so no one has to sit and wait while you type.
All relevant information should be sent in a single message if possible.
