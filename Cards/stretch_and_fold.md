Stretching and folding the dough helps it form stronger gluten without crushing the gluten.
- Steps:
	- Grab the top of the dough
	- Pull/stretch it up a decent way, then push/fold it back down near the middle of the dough
	- Rotate 90 degrees and repeat until a full rotation has been completed
This is usually completed half an hour into the rise time, and can be repeated throughout it
