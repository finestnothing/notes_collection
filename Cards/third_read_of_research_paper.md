# third_read_of_research_paper

- Potentially comes after the [[second_read_of_research_paper]], but this step is not always reached.
- Approximately 4-5 hours for a beginner (depending on length and complexity of paper), but can be as short as 1 hour with enough experience
- Extremely in-depth
- Read the entire paper, including the proofs and in-depth sections, visuals, etc
	- Breakdown and challenge every assumption that the paper makes
- Purpose is to be able to understand the paper well enough to recreate it or a write a similar paper using the same assumptions
	- Compare and contrast your conclusions with the ones that the author reached. This lets you both improve your own skills, and potentially find errors and hidden assumptions in the original paper
	- This will help you understand the content and proof much better
- At the end of the third pass, you should be able to at least remake the outline and structure of the paper, highlight its strengths and weaknesses, and know any issues/errors/false conclusions, etc
- If the paper is on a similar subject to what you're researching, make your own notes as you move through to be used for future research
	- Can be certain assumptions, conclusions, proofs, etc
	- Make sure to write down where in the paper you got them!
