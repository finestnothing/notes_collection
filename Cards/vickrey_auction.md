- Ideal for game theory
- Like a blind auction, except the winning bid pays the second highest bid price
- Made by economist William Vickrey
- From a game theory perspective here, it is optimal to bid what you see the item as worth
	- If you win, you pay less than you saw it as worth (whatever the second highest bid was)
	- If you lose, you don't get it but you also didn't overpay at all
- E.G.
	- If I see it as worth $25 and the next highest bid is $10, we both should bid what we see it as worth
	- Then I pay $10 and the other bidder doesn't overpay (since they don't get it)
