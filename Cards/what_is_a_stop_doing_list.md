Created: 2022-06-22 11:45

- A stop doing list is a list of things you want to remember to not do, just like a normal list is a reminder of things to do
- Example list:
	- Stop unlocking phone before 8:00 AM
	- Don't randomly check your phone, only check it on intervals
	- Don't snack after 7:00 PM
	- Stop buying useless things
	- Stop spending more than 5 minutes on your phone at work
