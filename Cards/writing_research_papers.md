- While using the [[what_is_the_three_pass_process|three pass process]] is great, most people will only read research papers once.
- Making sure you answer the 5 C's ([[first_read_of_research_paper]]) is very helpful anyway
- If it can't be understood in one pass, it will likely never be published. If the abstract and introduction are bad, it's unlikely to ever be read fully even if it gets published.
- Organization in the paper is key
