## Notes
- Sammy was a complete menace for the morning walk.
	- Found what I assume was cream cheese and starting scarfing it down
	- Encountered a squirrel, had to physically drag him away
	- Popcorn all over the god damn grass?
	- After the squirrel and cream cheese he was constantly sniffing and looking for more food
