Monthly Vendor Meeting
- Safety/field
	- H2S - be careful
		- Contact pge inspector, let them know about it. They will likely contact the city.
	- Verbage
		- Don't tell field/construction that it is clear. Tell them it has been run and still waiting on QC.
	- Daily Schedules
		- Sometimes have work already done on the daily schedule, make sure that the schedule is correct for the work that will be completed
	- Field crews have been on top of safety
- David Salas
	- Sherry will be out for several weeks, make sure to send to invoicing box.
	- Make sure everything is accounted for during inspections
		- Showing access points (if we accessed it, or found it but could not access it)
		- Note any CB's or MH's even if they're under cars and can't be accessed
