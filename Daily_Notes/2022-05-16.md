## Notes
- Playing [[path_of_exile]], making a new character
- AWS Initial Interview Notes
	- Slow server, performance degraded. Full to half speed
		- Customers having difficulty accessing services
		- aws servers are EC2 instances
	- API
		- Authorized user deleted data drive
	- I think it went decently well, it would be a cool place to work even if mainly a glorified IT service
		- Good experience and pay
- Reading [[the_starless_crown]]
