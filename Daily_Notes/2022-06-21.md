## Notes
- Second [[interview]] with [[SFL_scientific]] today, it went well
- Final interview with [[Dynatrace]], definitely slacked off on making a presentation

## Work
- 220088
	- Start 7:00
	- End 

Top of SD's are 22 inches deep from pavement
Beck Rd is most important
May want to inspect Intersection of Cordelia and Beck too
Line M and Line S
Line O was trenched
Line A was trenched - Told by City that they would have enough clearance
	Need to backfill the trench and bore it (due to the city)
If they bore to get under the SD on M, they may bore S to get under it as well
