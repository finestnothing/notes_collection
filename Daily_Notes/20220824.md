## Notes

## Work
- One on one with [[Danny Bradford]]
	- Dexter is the other new data engineer
	- Weekly techES rotates who leads it based on who has the most going on
	- These meetings are in the middle of HR, general stuff (latest recommendations for watching), work stuff, etc
	- Primary focus has always been the public API's
	- My dept is a pretty new one
		- Need to change how we manage the group from a task perspective
		- Not many real changing unique circumstances
		- Sam is working on a proof of concept for making it more agile
			- Better than a project with main goals that is done waterfall
		- Agile means you can't use "Project", you just have a "Product"
		- Product team grabs all the requirements, goes extremely in depth to get a specific project goal
			- E.G. client wants infinite number of emails. Do you want 18 spots, a button to add more, etc. Then, throw the project in a bucket to be grabbed later to be done
		- Engineering services has 2 more projects of building major things
			- Then switching to sprints/agile once those are released
			- Might end up moving eng services to Jira

					- Has billing integration (billing, rate cards, etc)
