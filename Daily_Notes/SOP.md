# SOP for AirX Utility Surveyors
- Map and Log QC
	- Make changes to map and log to meet crossbore requirements
	- Includes adding anything that was missed previously, anything that isn't determined until the end of a project (No SM, No SD, customer contact issues)
	- Map uses basic autocad functions
- Send deliverables to PG&E project managers
	- Address any revisions or questions that come back as soon as possible
- Look at rejection reports as they come in, address any contestable segments (called missing but should've been sent, unclear to/from etc)
	- Other segments will need to be reshot or addressed in some other way (depending on reason)
- Move jobs to "Ready to burn" folder in Q drive when the jobs are confirmed by the PG&E coordinator
- Answer any questions from the project managers for ongoing projects (progress checks, etc)
- Update PG&E PM's weekly on UTA issues for jobs that take longer than a week
	- Need to get cleaning quotes for any relevant segments from Dave
