# blog_content_guidelines
Created: 2022-09-29 18:24

- The content and writing can be as formal or informal as I like
	- Consistency is important though
- It's best to talk about things that I like or am passionate about
	- Tutorials for stuff I had trouble with, ramblings, intros to stuff
	- Shouldn't be done just for the money, the passion has to be for the content, not money
		- Should be treated like a product from [[my_product_is_my_garden]]
- Include photos when relevant
	- Personally I hate photos, but it would cool to have at least a splash image for posts
- Tag and add categories to all posts
- Original content only! Can reference other content or sources, but don't just parrot stuff
