## Bootstrapping
- Popularized by the IndieHackers movement
	- The indiehackers movement basically said you don't need to make something entirely new or revolutionary to be successful
	- It's okay to just make a personal take on something, with features you like more, a nice interface, etc
- What it isn't:
	- Hustling your app/course/software/idea to make money immediately (working on it constantly)
	- A rapid get rich quick plan
	- Replacement for a job in the short term
- What it is:
	- Slow and gradual releases
	- Work on it as you have time
	- Build it how you want and not cutting corners

### Analogy
- My product is my garden - Software
	- Plants require maintenance (nurturing, weeding, etc) - Adding new features, bug fixes, etc
	- Requires research - New technologies, software, etc
	- What grows well near other plants - How your product works compared to others, what it complements, what features work well together

### Ideology
You should try to putter about on your project.
Spend time on it, have a good time doing it.
Do it because it's enjoyable!
Don't focus on the product for the sake of it growing, work on it to ensure it is useful to you and it's userbase and continually improving everyone's experience with them.

### Goals
Once the product income meets basic profitability (makes enough for you to live on, etc), you can choose to focus on the product more.
This would let you quit your main job and be able to focus on the product full time, hopefully still enjoying it.
