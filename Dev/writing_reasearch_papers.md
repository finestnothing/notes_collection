- While using the three-pass process is great, most people will only read research papers once.
- Making sure you answer the 5 C's (see First Read of Research Paper) is very helpful anyway
- If it can't be understood in one pass, it will likely never be published. If the abstract and introduction are bad, it's unlikely to ever be read fully.
- Organization in the paper is key
