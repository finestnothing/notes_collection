### Description
#### Dungeon
- The dungeon level underneath Death House is carved out of earth, clay, and rock. 
	- The tunnels are 4 feet wide by 7 feet high with timber braces at 5-foot intervals. 
	- Rooms are 8 feet tall and supported by thick wooden posts with crossbeams. 
	- The only exception is [area 38](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#38RitualChamber "area 38"), which has a 16-foot-high ceiling supported by stone pillars. 
	- Characters without [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) must provide their own light sources, as the dungeon is unlit.
	- As the characters explore the dungeon, they see centuries-old human footprints in the earthen floor leading every which way.
- The wooden spiral staircase from the attic ends here. A narrow tunnel stretches southward before branching east and west.

### Interactables
#### Ghostly Chanting
- From the moment they arrive in the dungeon, the characters can hear an eerie, incessant chant echoing throughout. 
- It’s impossible to gauge where the sound is coming from until the characters reach [area 26](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#26HiddenSpikedPit "area 26") or [29](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#29GhoulishEncounter "29"). 
- They can’t discern its words until they reach [area 35](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#35Reliquary "area 35").
