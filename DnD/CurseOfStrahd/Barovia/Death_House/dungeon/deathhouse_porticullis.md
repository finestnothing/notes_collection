### Description
### Interactables
- This tunnel is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis that can be forcibly lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) check. 
- Otherwise, the portcullis can be raised or lowered by turning a wooden wheel half-embedded in the east wall of area 38. 
- (The wheel is beyond the reach of someone east of the portcullis.) 
- The floor around the portcullis is submerged under 2 feet of murky water.
