### Description
- The ghostly chant emanating from [area 38](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#38RitualChamber "area 38") fills this room. 
	- Characters can discern a dozen or so voices saying, over and over, “He is the Ancient. He is the Land.”
- The cult amassed several “relics” that it used in its rituals. These worthless items are stored in thirteen niches along the walls:
	-   A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a goblin’s hand) on a loop of rope
	-   A knife carved from a human bone
	-   A dagger with a rat’s skull set into the pommel
	-   An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a nothic’s eye
	-   An aspergillum carved from bone
	-   A folded cloak made from stitched ghoul skin
	-   A desiccated frog lashed to a stick (could be mistaken for a [wand of polymorph](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/wand-of-polymorph))
	-   A bag full of bat guano
	-   A hag’s severed finger
	-   A 6-inch-tall wooden figurine of a mummy, its arms crossed over its chest
	-   An iron pendant adorned with a devil’s face
	-   The shrunken, shriveled head of a halfling
	-   A small wooden coffer containing a dire wolf’s withered tongue
- The southernmost tunnel slopes down at a 20-degree angle into murky water and ends at a rusty portcullis ([area 37](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#37Portcullis "area 37")).
