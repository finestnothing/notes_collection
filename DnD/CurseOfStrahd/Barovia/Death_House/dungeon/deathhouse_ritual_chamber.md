### Description
- Read to players
	- The chanting stops as you peer into this forty-foot-square room. 
	- The smooth masonry walls provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and a breach in the west wall leads to a dark cave heaped with refuse. 
	- Murky water covers most of the floor. 
	- Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. 
	- In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. 
	- Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. 
	- The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood.
- The water is 2 feet deep. 
- The ledges and central dais are 5 feet high (3 feet higher than the water’s surface), and the chamber’s ceiling is 16 feet high (11 feet above the dais and ledges). 
- The chains dangling from the ceiling are 8 feet long; the cultists would shackle prisoners to the chains, dangle them above the altar, cut them open with knives, and allow the altar to be bathed in blood.
- Half embedded in the east wall is a wooden wheel connected to hidden chains and mechanisms. 
	- A character can use an action to turn the wheel, raising or lowering the nearby portcullis (see [area 37](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#37Portcullis "area 37")).

- The hole in the west wall leads to a naturally formed alcove.
	- The half-submerged pile of refuse that fills it is a [shambling mound](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/shambling-mound), which the cultists dubbed Lorghoth the Decayer.

	- Read to players:
		- The chanting rises once more as thirteen dark apparitions appear on the ledges overlooking the room. 
		- Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch’s fire is black and seems to draw light into it. 
		- Where you’d expect to see faces are voids.
		- “One must die!” they chant, over and over. “One must die! One must die!”
	- The apparitions are harmless figments that can’t be damaged, turned, or dispelled.

### Interactables
#### Shambling Mound
- It is asleep but awakens if attacked or if the characters summon the cultists but refuse to complete their ritual (see “One Must Die!” below). 
- A character standing next to the mound can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature)) check.
#### One Must Die
- Characters on the dais when the cultists appear must sacrifice a creature on the altar or face the cult’s wrath; characters can ascertain what must be done with a successful DC 11 Intelligence ([Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion)) or Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight)) check. 
- To count as a sacrifice, a creature must die on the altar. 
- The apparitions don’t care what kind of creature is sacrificed, and they aren’t fooled by illusions.
- If the characters make the sacrifice, the cultists fade away, but their tireless chant of “He is the Ancient. He is the Land,” echoes again in the dungeon. 
	- Strahd is aware of the sacrifice, and Death House now does nothing to hinder the characters (see “Endings” below).
- If the characters leave the dais without making the sacrifice, the cultists’ chant changes: “Lorghoth the Decayer, we awaken thee!” 
	- This chant rouses the shambling mound and prompts it to attack. 
	- It pursues prey beyond the room but won’t leave the dungeon. 
	- It can move through tunnels without squeezing and completely fills its space. 
	- At the start of the shambling mound’s first turn, the chant changes again: “The end comes! Death, be praised!” If the shambling mound dies, the chanting stops and the apparitions vanish forever.
	- [Shambling Mound](#Shambling%20Mound)
#### Endings
- The mists of Ravenloft continue to surround Death House until the characters stand atop the dais and either appease or defy the cultists. 
	- Strahd is satisfied either way, prompting the mists to recede.
##### Sacrifice
- Death House harbors no ill will toward a party willing to sacrifice a life to appease the cult. 
	- Once the sacrifice is made, the characters are free to go. 
	- Upon emerging from the house, the characters advance to 3rd level.
##### No Sacrifice
- If the characters deny the cult its sacrifice and either destroy the shambling mound or escape from it, Death House attacks them as they try to leave. 
- When they return upstairs, they must roll initiative as they discover several architectural changes:
	- All the windows are bricked up; the bricked-up windows and the outer walls are impervious to the party’s weapon attacks and damage-dealing spells.
	- All the doors are gone, replaced by slashing scythe-blades. 
		- A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics)) check to pass through a blade-trapped doorway unscathed. 
		- A character who spends 1 minute studying the blades in a particular doorway can try to take advantage of a momentary gap in their repeating movements and make a DC 15 Intelligence check instead. 
		- Failing either check, a character takes 2d10 slashing damage but manages to pass through the doorway. 
		- Any creature pushed through a doorway must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the damage. 
		- The blades can’t be disarmed.
	- Every room that contains a fireplace, an oven, or a stove is filled with poisonous black smoke. 
		- The room is heavily obscured, and any creature that starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d10 poison damage.
	- The interior walls become rotted and brittle. 
		- Each 5-foot-section has AC 5 and 5 hit points, and can also be destroyed with a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) check. 
		- Each 5-foot section of wall that’s destroyed causes a [swarm of rats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swarm-of-rats) to pour out and attack. 
		- The swarm won’t leave the house.
- Keep track of initiative as the characters make their way through the house. 
- Once they escape, they advance to 3rd level, and the house does no more to harm them.
