### Initial Description
#### Kitchen (4A)
- The kitchen (area 4A) is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. 
- A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. 
- A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. 
- Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a well-stocked pantry (area 4B).
#### Pantry (4B)
- All the food in the pantry appears fresh but tastes bland.
- [Dumbwaiter](#Dumbwaiter)
	- Behind a small door in the southwest corner of the kitchen is a dumbwaiter—a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. 
	- The shaft connects to [areas 7A](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#7ServantsRoom "areas 7A") (the servants’ quarters) and [12A](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#12MasterSuite "12A") (the master bedroom). 
	- Hanging on the wall next to the dumbwaiter is a tiny brass bell attached by wires to buttons in those other areas.
### Interactables
#### Dumbwaiter
- A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics)) check.
	- The dumbwaiter’s rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.
