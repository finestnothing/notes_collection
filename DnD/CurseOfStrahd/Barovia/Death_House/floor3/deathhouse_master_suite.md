		- a four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils,
		- a matching pair of empty wardrobes, a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and jewelry box (see [Treasure](#Treasure))
		- and a padded chair. 
	- A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of Gustav and Elisabeth Durst hanging above it.

- A door facing the foot of the bed has a full-length mirror mounted on it.
	- The door opens to reveal an empty, dust-choked closet (area 12B).
