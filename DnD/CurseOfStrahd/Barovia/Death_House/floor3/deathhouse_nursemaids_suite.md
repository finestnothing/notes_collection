## About
### Location
Town: `= this.town`
Building: `= this.building`
Function: `= this.function`
Room: `= this.room`
Floor: `= this.floor` 
### Description
- Dust and cobwebs shroud an elegantly appointed bedroom (area 15A) and an adjoining nursery (area 15B). 
	- See [Nursemaid Specter](#Nursemaid%20Specter) when players enter the nursery
- Double doors set with panes of stained glass pull open to reveal a balcony (area 15C) overlooking the front of the house.
- The bedroom once belonged to the family’s nursemaid. 
	- The master of the house and the nursemaid had an affair, which led to the birth of a stillborn baby named Walter. 
	- The cult slew the nursemaid shortly thereafter. 
- The bedroom contains a large bed, two end tables, and an empty wardrobe. 
- Mounted on the wall next to the wardrobe is a full-length mirror with an ornate wooden frame carved to look like ivy and berries. See [Walls](#Walls) and [Secret Door](#Secret%20Door)
- The nursery contains a crib covered with a hanging black shroud. When characters part the shroud, they see a tightly wrapped, baby-sized bundle lying in the crib. Characters who unwrap the blanket find nothing inside it.
### Interactables
#### Nursemaid Specter
- Unless the characters already defeated it in [area 18](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#18StorageRoom "area 18"), the nursemaid’s spirit haunts the bedroom as a [specter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/specter). 
- The specter manifests and attacks when a character opens the door to the nursery. 
- The specter resembles a terrified, skeletally thin young woman; it can’t speak or be reasoned with.
#### Walls
- Characters who search the wall for secret doors or otherwise inspect the mirror can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check, notice eyeballs among the berries. 
- The wall behind the mirror has a secret door in it (see “Secret Door” below).
#### Secret Door
- A secret door behind the mirror can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check. 
- It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.
