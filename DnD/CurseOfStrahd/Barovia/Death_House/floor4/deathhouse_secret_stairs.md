## About
### Location
Town: `= this.town`
Building: `= this.building`
Function: `= this.function`
Room: `= this.room`
Floor: `= this.floor` 
### Description
- A narrow spiral staircase made of creaky wood is contained within a 5-foot-wide shaft of mortared stone that starts in the attic and descends 50 feet to the dungeon level, passing through the lower levels of the house as it makes its descent. 
- Thick cobwebs fill the shaft and reduce visibility in the staircase to 5 feet.
- The secret door and shaft don’t exist until the house reveals them, which can happen in one of two ways:
	- The characters find Strahd’s letter in the secret room behind the library ([area 9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#9SecretRoom "area 9")).
	- The characters find the replica secret door in the attic of the dollhouse ([area 20](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#20ChildrensRoom "area 20")).
- Once the house wills the secret door into existence, characters find it automatically if they search the wall (no ability check required).
- Characters who descend the spiral staircase end up in area 22.
