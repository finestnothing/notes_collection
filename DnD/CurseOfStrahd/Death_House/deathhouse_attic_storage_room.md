## About
### Location

Function: `= this.function`
Room: `= this.room`
Floor: `= this.floor` 
### Description
- This dusty chamber is packed with old furniture (chairs, coat racks, standing mirrors, dress mannequins, and the like), all draped in dusty white sheets. 
- Near an iron stove, underneath one of the sheets, is an unlocked wooden trunk containing the skeletal remains of the family’s nursemaid, wrapped in a tattered bedsheet stained with dry blood. [Nursemaid Skeleton](#Nursemaid%20Skeleton)
### Interactables
#### Nursemaid Skeleton
- A character inspecting the remains and succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine)) check can verify that the woman was stabbed to death by multiple knife wounds.
- If the characters disturb the remains, the nursemaid’s [specter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/specter) appears and attacks unless it was previously defeated in [area 15](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#15NursemaidsSuite "area 15").
#### Secret Door
- A secret door in the east wall appears only when certain conditions are met; see [area 21](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#21SecretStairs "area 21") for more information.
	- The characters find Strahd’s letter in the secret room behind the library ([area 9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#9SecretRoom "area 9")).
	- The characters find the replica secret door in the attic of the dollhouse ([area 20](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#20ChildrensRoom "area 20")).
