### Initial Description
- This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter’s den.
- Mounted above the fireplace is a stag’s head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are three stuffed wolves.
- Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face the hearth, with an oak table between them supporting a cask of wine, two carved wooden goblets, a pipe rack, and a candelabrum. 
- A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs.
- Two cabinets stand against the walls. [Interactables](#Interactables)
### Interactables
#### East Cabinet
- The east cabinet sports a lock that can be picked with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. 
	- It holds a [heavy crossbow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-heavy), a [light crossbow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-light), a [hand crossbow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-hand), and 20 [bolts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crossbow-bolts) for each weapon. 
#### North Cabinet
- The north cabinet is unlocked and holds a small box containing a [deck of playing cards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/playing-card-set) and an assortment of wine glasses.
#### Trapdoor
- A trapdoor is hidden in the southwest corner of the floor. It can’t be detected or opened until the characters approach it from the underside (see [area 32](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#32HiddenTrapdoor "area 32")). Until then, Death House supernaturally hides the trapdoor.
