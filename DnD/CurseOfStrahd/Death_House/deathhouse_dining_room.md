### Initial Description

- A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. [Silverware Crystal Portrait Tapestry](#Silverware%20Crystal%20Portrait%20Tapestry)

- The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. [Walls](#Walls)
- Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry depicting hunting dogs and horse-mounted aristocrats chasing after a wolf hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall. [Silverware Crystal Portrait Tapestry](#Silverware%20Crystal%20Portrait%20Tapestry)
### Interactables
#### Walls
- Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check, see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking amid the carved foliage.
#### Silverware, Crystal, Portrait, Tapestry
- The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.
