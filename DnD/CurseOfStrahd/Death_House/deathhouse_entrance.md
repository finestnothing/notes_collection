### Initial Description
#### Front door (1A)
- A wrought-iron gate with hinges on one side and a lock on the other fills the archway of a stone portico.
- The gate is unlocked, and its rusty hinges shriek when the gate is opened.
- Oil lamps hang from the portico ceiling by chains, flanking a set of oaken doors that open into a grand foyer (area 1B).
#### Foyer (1B)
- Hanging on the south wall of the foyer is a shield emblazoned with a coat-of-arms (a stylized golden windmill on a red field), flanked by framed portraits of stony-faced aristocrats (long-dead members of the Durst family). 
- Mahogany-framed double doors leading from the foyer to the main hall (area 2A) are set with panes of stained glass.
