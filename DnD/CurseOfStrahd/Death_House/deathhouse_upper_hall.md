- Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of the Durst family: Gustav and Elisabeth Durst with their two smiling children, Rose and Thorn.
	- Cradled in the father’s arms is a swaddled baby, which the mother regards with a hint of scorn.
- Standing suits of armor flank wooden doors in the east and west walls. 
	- Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf’s head.
- The doors are carved with dancing youths [Doors](#Doors)
