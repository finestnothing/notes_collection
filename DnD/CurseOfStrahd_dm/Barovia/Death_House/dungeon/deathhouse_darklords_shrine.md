### Description
- Read to players
	- This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls. 
	- A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands next to him. 
	- In his right hand, he holds a smoky-gray crystal orb.
	- The room has exits in the west and north walls. Chanting can be heard coming from the west.
### Interactables
#### Concealed Door
- Characters searching the room for secret doors find a concealed door in the middle of the east wall with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check. 
- Itâ€™s basically an ordinary (albeit rotted) wooden door hidden under a layer of clay. The door pulls open to reveal a stone staircase that climbs 10 feet to a landing (area 32).
- The staircase ends at a landing with a 6-foot-high ceiling of close-fitting planks with a wooden trapdoor set into it. 
- The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side and can be pushed open to reveal the den ([area 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#3DenofWolves "area 3")) above.
- Once the trapdoor has been found and opened, it remains available to characters as a way into and out of the dungeon level.
#### Treasure
- The [crystal orb](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/orb) is worth 25 gp. 
- It can be used as an arcane focus but is not magical.
