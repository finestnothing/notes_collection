## About
### Location
Town: `= this.town`
Building: `= this.building`
Function: `= this.function`

### Description
- This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. 
- Moldy humanoid bones lie strewn on the dirt floor—the remains of the cult’s vile banquets.
- In the middle of the south wall is a darkened alcove (area 28). [Larder](#Larder)

### Interactables
#### Larder
- Characters who approach within 5 feet of the alcove provoke the creature that lurks there.
- This alcove contains a [grick](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/grick) that slithers out to attack the first character it sees within 5 feet of it. 
- Any character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score under 12 is surprised by it. 
- The alcove is otherwise empty.
#### Ghoulish Encounter
- The ghostly chanting heard throughout the dungeon is noticeably louder to the north. 
- When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the four-way tunnel intersection, four [ghouls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ghoul) (former cultists) rise up out of the ground in the spaces marked X on [the map](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#MapB1DeathHouse "the map") and attack. 
- The ghouls fight until destroyed.
