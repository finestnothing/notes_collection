## About
### Location
Town: `= this.town`
Building: `= this.building`
Function: `= this.function`
Room: `= this.room`
Floor: `= this.floor` 
### Description
- Locked from outside [Locked Door](deathhouse_attic_hall.md#Locked%20Door)
- Read to Players:
	- This room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds sized for children. 
	- Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that’s a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. 
	- These furnishings are draped in cobwebs.
	-  Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing. 
	- The smaller of the two cradles a stuffed doll that you also recognize.
- The Durst children, [Rose](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/rose-durst) and [Thorn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/thorn-durst), were neglected by their parents and locked in this room until they starved to death. 
	- Their small skeletons lie in the middle of the floor, plain as day, wearing tattered clothing that the characters recognize as belonging to the children. 
	- Thorn’s skeleton cradles the boy’s stuffed doll.
### Interactables
#### Toy Chest
- The toy chest contains an assortment of stuffed animals and toys. 
#### Dollhouse
- Characters who search the dollhouse and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check find all of the house’s secret doors, including one in the attic that leads to a spiral staircase (a miniature replica of [area 21](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#21SecretStairs "area 21")).
#### Rose and Thorn
- If either the dollhouse or the chest is disturbed, the ghosts of [Rose](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/rose-durst) and [Thorn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/thorn-durst) appear in the middle of the room. 
	- Use the [ghost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ghost) statistics in the _[Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")_, with the following modifications:
		- The ghosts are Small and lawful good.
		- They have 35 (10d6) hit points each.
		- They lack the Horrifying Visage action.
		- They speak Common and have a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP).

- The children don’t like it when the characters disturb their toys, but they fight only in self-defense. 
	- Unlike the illusions outside the house, these children know that they’re dead. 
	- If asked how they died, Rose and Thorn explain that their parents locked them in the attic to protect them from “the monster in the basement,” and that they died from hunger.
	- If asked how one gets to the basement, Rose points to the dollhouse and says, “There’s a secret door in the attic.” 
		- Characters who then search the dollhouse for secret doors gain advantage on their Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks to find them. [Dollhouse](#Dollhouse)

- The children fear abandonment. If one or more characters try to leave, the ghost-children attempt to possess them. 
	- If one of the ghosts possesses a character, allow the player to retain control of the character, but assign the character one of the following flaws:
		- A character possessed by Rose gains the following flaw: “I like being in charge and get angry when other people tell me what to do.”
		- A character possessed by Thorn gains the following flaw: “I’m scared of everything, including my own shadow, and weep with despair when things don’t go my way.”
		- A character possessed by the ghost of Rose or Thorn won’t willingly leave Death House or the dungeon below it. 
		- Both ghosts can be intimidated into leaving their hosts with a successful DC 11 Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation)) check made as an action.
	- A ghost reduced to 0 hit points can reform at dawn the next day. 
	- The only way to put the children’s spirits to rest is to put their skeletal remains in their tombs ([areas 23E](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#23ERosesCrypt "areas 23E") and [23F](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-b-death-house#23FThornsCrypt "23F")). The children don’t know this, however. [Development](#Development)

##### Development
- If the party lays the children’s spirits to rest, each character gains inspiration (see “[Inspiration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#Inspiration "Inspiration")” in chapter 4, “Personality and Background,” of the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook")).
