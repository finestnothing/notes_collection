## About
### Playing Strahd
- #### Roleplaying Strahd
	- Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn’t suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.
	- When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of Tatyana, but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn’t have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.
	- In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still—not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won’t yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd’s humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he’s preying on Ireena Kolyana, he tells them that Ireena’s body is the host for Tatyana’s soul, and Tatyana’s soul belongs to him.
	- Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a time—playthings to possess or discard as he desires.
	- If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn’t honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.

- #### When Strahd Attacks
	- Strahd isn’t a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from it—he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading. His combat details are available in [appendix D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-d-monsters-and-npcs#StrahdvonZarovich "appendix D").
	- When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day. If they’re indoors, he tries to charm or goad a character into inviting him inside (along with his vampire spawn, if they are present). Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena.
	- These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.

### Backstory
####  History
- Count, prince, soldier, and conquerer
- Father died, Strahd finished all of his families enemies
	- Cornered them in a valley and slaughtered them
	- Name Barovia after him
- Studied magic after settling in Barovia
	- Forged a pact with Shadowfell in return for immortality
- Tatyana
	- She fell in love with Strahds younger brother, Sergei
	- Strahd saw her as a worthy bride and showered her with gifts
	- On the day of Tatyana and Sergeis wedding, he killed Sergei and drank his blood
		- This sealed the pact with the Shadowfell

		- Did not die, became a vampire and slaughtered the guards
		- Saw his parents in the clouds, destroyed his bloodline and doomed Barovia
		- The castle and entire Barovia valley was locked into a Domain of Dread, surrounded by fog
			- Now called the domain of Ravenloft
#### Goals
- Turn Ireena Kolyana
	- Strahd’s unrequited love for Tatyana drove him to slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman Ireena Kolyana in the village of Barovia and felt extreme déjà vu. Ireena looked exactly like Tatyana! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of Tatyana, and thus he seeks to claim her.
	- Strahd’s evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home—the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Barovia—and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort.
	- [Chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-village-of-barovia "Chapter 3") gives details about Ireena and where to find her in the village of Barovia.
- #### Find Rudolph van Richten
	- Although he is usually focused on making Ireena Kolyana his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten has come to Barovia. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching Barovia for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.
	- [Chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-town-of-vallaki "Chapter 5") describes the town of Vallaki, where van Richten currently resides incognito.
- Search for a Successor or Consort
	- Strahd can sense the arrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter Barovia, he shifts his attention from Ireena Kolyana and van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn’t arrive at this conclusion immediately.)
	- Strahd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued—even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.
