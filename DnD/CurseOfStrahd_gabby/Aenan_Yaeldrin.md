### Backstory
- Circle of the Land - Underdark
- Rarely met with other druids in caves
	- Safeguard ancient knowledge through oral tradition
	- Circle of stones
	- Became a druid after becoming a hermit, encountered the other druids while exploring and looking for food
- Lived in a cave myself
	- In a mountain, surrounded by forest
	- Prefer vegetables, would grow my own (or forage) and avoid eating meat unless absolutely necessary
	- Would protect my region from invaders and aggressive animals
		- Okay with predators, but would limit population to maintain balance
		- Would scare away adventurers not showing respect for the area
			- Occasionally would have to fight them, or use spells to force them to leave
