#### Instructions:

	- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
	- 4 tbsp butter
- Add and whisk until fully melted
	- 1 1/2 cup cheese (Gruyere and/or parmesan)
	- Chopped parsley
- Add some pasta water
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Add noodles/pasta or serve


#### Review:
Pretty easy to make, 1 cup gruyere 1/2 cup parmesan is really strong but still really good.

Served it with grilled chicken on homemade [pasta](pasta.md) on [2022-05-06](../../Daily_Notes/2022-05-06.md) for dinner and it was awesome
