- Dutch auction (descending auction)
	- Price moves down, first bid wins
	- Bad for game theory
	- Likely to be worried and overpay, or not bid at your valued price and lose trying to save money
- English auction (ascending auction)
	- More popular than Dutch auction
	- Information cascade
		- You may not have the best information, so you use other people behavior as a cue for their information
		- They may be doing the same to you, so you both bid because each other are bidding so both would overpay
	- Very likely to overpay due to public and private information conflicts
- Blind auction
	- Everyone places their bid at once, highest wins
	- You have to try to anticipate the worth of the product from your opponents point of view and bid accordingly
	- They will be doing the same though, so you have to bid higher than they think that you think it's worth, and so on and so forth
	- Likely to overpay, not ideal in game theory
- Vickrey Auction
	- Like a blind auction, except the highest bid pays the second highest bid price
	- Made by William Vickrey
	- It is optimal to bid what just you think it's worth
	- Either you win and pay a lower price than you thought it was worth, or you don't overpay
	- If I think it's worth $25 and my opponent thinks it's worth $10, I bid $25 and win, then pay $10.
	- If I think it's worth $10 and my opponent thinks it's worth $25, I bid $10, lose, and therefore don't overpay
