Use transactions to not break prod when making changes to SQL server database

Begin Transaction - enters transaction

SELECT @@TRANCOUNT - Says if you're in a transaction

ROLLBACK to get out of transaction and get rid of any changes
COMMIT to actually send the command (Leave this commented out until ready to deploy)

When in a transaction
	You're okay until you read or write to a table
		It locks everyone else out of accessing or changing the table until the transaction is committed or rolledback
		You can still access the table
