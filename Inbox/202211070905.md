# How DNS Works
- Server - has a web server with a specific IP Address (test.com)
- When client types in the ip (test.com), it doesn't actually know where to go yet
- Client sends request to the Root Name Server (.com) to get the location of test.com
	- Asks for the Authority Domain Name servers of test.com
- Browser sends a request to the DNS server with the (test) part of (test.com), along with the authority domain name servers
	- DNS Server returns the name servers (google.com in my case)
	- Browser then asks for the A-Record from the name servers, the actual IP address to connect to
- Then browser can connect to the server (my raspberry pi) and ask for whatever is hosted at test.com

# VPS
- Virtual Private Server
	- In my case, a local raspberry pi or something
- Running arch linux with at least 20gb of storage
- SSH Config
