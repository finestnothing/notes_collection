Linux Read Write Execute permissions with 3 number format

1 - Execute
2 - Write
4 - Read
These are summed together to give multiple permissions at once
- E.G.
	- 1 - Execute only
	- 2 - write only
	- 3 - Write and execute
	- 4 - Read only
	- 5 - Read and execute
	- 6 - read and write
	- 7 - read, write, and execute

The three groups:
- owner
	- whoever owns the file
	- Usually who ever made it
- group
	- Can contain multiple users
	- Easier than assigning permissions to every individual user, if they'll all have the same
- public
	- Any person who can find the file somewhere
	- Doesn't have to be an owner or in any group that has permissions
- To specify specific permissions, the first number is owner permissions, second number is group permissions, last number is public permissions
	- 111 - Everyone can execute
	- 764 - Owner RWE, group RW, public W
	- 777 - Everyone can RWE

Group stuff

- Create a new group
	- `groupadd -g {group_id} {group_name}`
	- {group_id} is a numeric identifier for the group
	- {group_name} is a string
- Modify what groups a user is in
	- `usermod -G {all groups} {user_name}`
	- {all groups} should be a comma separated list of all groups the user should be in
		- They will *only* be in the listed groups after this command.
		- They are removed from any unlisted groups, and added to any new groups in the list
	- {user_name} determines what user to modify their groups
- See what users are in a group
	- `getent group {group_name}`
