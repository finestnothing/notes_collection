e.g. means `exempli gratia`, which means "for example".

i.e. is used to say a particular meaning
`One meal (i.e., breakfast) is included in the price of the room`
Used to form independent clauses (contains a subject and verb with a complete thought)
"that is breakfast" is an independent clause

`Certain fur-bearing mammals, e.g., nutria and otters, spend much of their lives in the water.`
Should NOT form an independent clause
`for example, nutria and otters` doesn't express a complete thought
