It may be worth trying out the cornell method for notes
Divide the page into three categories:

- summary
	- Main ideas and topics that occurred
	- Not meant for specifics, just topics
- note-taking
	- All key-points go here
	- specific notes
	- Should try not to get *everything* the speaker says, just the key ideas
- recall
	- Questions and ways to remember the info
	- Followup questions
	- Context

After the meeting or lecture, revisit the notes
	Add any missing info
	Add more to the recall and summary sections
