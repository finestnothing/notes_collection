# The Stars are Legion
## By Kameron Hurley
### Review
- [[2022-06-07]] - Page 46/Chapter 5 - I like it so far, but it is very weird and vague. Well reviewed though and I look forward to reading more.

### Final Thoughts
- This book was awesome. It was definitely weird and kind of gross, but it got *really* good, so I'm glad I stuck with it.
