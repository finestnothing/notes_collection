# Obsidian Publish
## Status: #project/active 
## Description
- Wanting to begin publishing my notes, both for others to view and for an easy way to view them in the future.
- https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/%2B+Start+Here - Great example. Need to figure out how to make it look something like that, because I love how it looks.
- Maybe with a more retro theme?

## Notes
- [ ] Start using front matter. May need to restart my notes a bit to do this
