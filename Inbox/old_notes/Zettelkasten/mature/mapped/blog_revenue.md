- Many sources of income for a blog, though it does take a large base to actually make money
- Ads
	- Not sure I want to do these
	- They're kinda gross, but are good money with a lot of viewers
	- Will likely have a setting to let people opt-out of seeing ads, even without an ad-blocker
- [[affiliate_products]]
	- Can make money from referring people to certain products or companies
	- It doesn't cost them any money, but I would prefer to not look like I'm just a product promotion blog
- Selling services
	- I can sell my own skills and time through the blog, on a case-by-case basis
	- Could be website creation services or advice, notetaking tips, work help, etc
