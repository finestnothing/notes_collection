- Task grouping is where you do all instances of a certain task at once, rather than as they come up
- You should determine how to group the tasks by the timeline required
	- If you have 31 days to do a type of task, pick one (or two) days per month to respond to all of them since your last time responding or handling them
	- If you have 30 minutes to respond to any given email, every 15 or 30 minutes respond to all new emails that you have received
- It is perfectly okay to not perfectly follow, as there are exceptions that come up that need to be handled sooner
