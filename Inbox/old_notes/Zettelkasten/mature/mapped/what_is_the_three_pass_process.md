- A three-stage system of reading research papers to be more efficient and better understand the information
- Consists of a first pass for basic overview, second pass for finding key points, and third (optional) phase for a deep dive to fully understand the findings
- Each step has a specific goal rather than just re-reading the paper three times fully
