### Final Thoughts
- This was a really good book, and definitely unique
- There were a couple "exciting" areas, but it was almost entirely thrilling because of the character development, not possibility of death.
- Definitely need to get the next book in the series
- Story of her meeting and growing with the crew, and a few other adventures that weren't solved by violence
