#### Review:
Beginning - [2022-03-23](../../Daily_Notes/2022-03-23.md) - A lot darker and grittier than the movie, but the same general concept, very well written already though. I think I'll like it a lot.
Middle - [2022-03-25](../../Daily_Notes/2022-03-25.md) - Continuing previous review, it's a lot darker and more in-depth than the movie, but so much better. Still loving every bit of it.
Middle - [2022-03-24](../../Daily_Notes/2022-03-24.md) - Still loving it all
End - [2022-04-20](../../Daily_Notes/2022-04-20.md) - Finished it today. It was awesome right through the end even though it was very different than the movie.

Sequel: [ready_player_two](ready_player_two.md)
