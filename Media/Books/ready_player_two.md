#### Review:
Start - [2022-04-20](../../Daily_Notes/2022-04-20.md) - Finished [ready_player_one](ready_player_one.md) today, started ready player two
Middle - [2022-04-28](../../Daily_Notes/2022-04-28.md) - It's been a lot sadder than the original book, but it is very interesting. I look forward to reading more of it.
End - [[2022-05-08]] - Finished, overall it was alright but it wasn't as great as I wanted. It got pretty dumb when Anoraks AI took over to be honest.
