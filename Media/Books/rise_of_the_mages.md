Really good book, there were a few slow points but they were important.
This tells the story of Emrael Ire, attempting to rescue his brother. 
He finds out that he is a mage, something that was stigmatized in their society following a previous war.
He grows a small group of friends and allies for his journey, jumping headfirst from one conflict to another, growing his magical powers.
