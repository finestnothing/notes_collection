#### Review:
- Good movie, but really weird in some places
- Loved all the magic, but it seemed like Doctor Strange could've done more based on what he did in Infinity wars
- At the end it has the trope of "I can't control it!" "Yes you can, just believe in yourself" then they are able to use their powers flawlessly
- Despite these, it was good

Sequel to [[doctor_strange]]
