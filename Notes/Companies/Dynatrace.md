- Presentation Notes
	- Three main problem areas
		- Scaling and diversity of systems
			- Dynatrace is lightweight, can connect to your entire tech stack and multiple websites, and is platform agnostic.
			- To track the scaling of your websites, Dynatrace also keeps track of all sorts of performance and usage information, so you can easily find what areas will most need to be scaled up and improved, and evaluate it after you have scaled as well
		- Information Gathering
			- Your main problem areas for Information Gathering are for telling how your user experience is, both in their usage and their response times.
			- The Apdex metric is a great metric for tracking your users experience. You are able to configure different thresholds (so a basic search is fine with a time of 2ms, while some data processing is fine with a time closer to 10ms) to get a more accurate picture of how your website is handling on the users side.
			- We also track user information, even as far as breaking down what OS and device they're on, so you can track modern systems
	- Feedback
