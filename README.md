# Notes Collection
Made in [https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/). Links are primarily wikilinks

- Zettelkasten
	- Seedlings
		- Notes taken directly from a source
		- Not copied, but not entirely original
	- Sprouts
		- "Grown up" seedlings
		- Rephrased entirely into my own thoughts and ideas
		- Expanded on the core ideas as well
	- Mature
		- "Grown up" sprouts
		- Broken down into smaller, more refined chunks
			- Single sprout may be all about making a startup
			- Mature may have 3 or 4 files from the one sprout, such as what to look for, signs you're doing well, how to get funding, etc
		- Basically atomic notes, linked together or to a central idea
	- Gardens
		- Links to multiple mature notes with a single common idea
		- "Startup Tips" would link to all directly related mature notes
	- Harvest
		- Projects that use zettelkasten notes
		- A good outline for a blog post, with the embedded relevant mature notes followed by original writing
