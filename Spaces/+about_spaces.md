Spaces are an important organizational tool. Whenever you run into something big, create a new space here.

Examples of uses for spaces:
- Large [[efforts]] to give them a dedicated place for files while building it out
- Work notes
- Personal plans and reviews (things that aren't knowledge based, etc)
- New areas of learning and expanding
- Whatever else needs its own space

Spaces aren't just project folders or areas for certain topics. They're both, plus [[efforts]] or anything else I need a space for.

Each space should have a file titled +info_{name}. This makes it so it's easy to find info and a directory for each space.
