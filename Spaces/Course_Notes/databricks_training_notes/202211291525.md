# DE 6.2 Introduction to Data Governance
- What is data governance
	- Data Access Control
		- Control who has access to the data
	- Data Access Audit
		- Capture and record all access to data (who accesses it and when)
	- Data Lineage
		- Capture upstream sources and downstream consumers
		- Be able to trace data from start to finish
		- Good for data quality and debugging
	- Data Discovery
		- Ability to search for and discover authorized assts
		- Makes it easier for each person to find everything they have access to

## Challenges in the Data Lake
- No fine-grained access controls
	- Can't restrict people to only have access to some data rows
- No common metadata layer
	- Entire security model needs to be updated if the file structures change at all
- Non-standard cloud-specific governance model
- Hard to audit
- No common governance model for different asset types

## How does Unity Catalog address the challenges
- Has fine-grained governance for data across clouds
	- Based on standard ANSI SQL
	- Lives outside of the workspaces and computing resources so it isn't dependent
- Unify Data and AI assets
	- All data types have a single interface
	- No need to transfer security changes
		- One change changes it everywhere
	- Data lineage is collected (but not yet publicly available)
- Unify existing Catalogs
	- Joins together existing data, storage, and catalogs without making you do a hard migration/copy
		- Should make it super easy to setup Unity Catalog
	- It is additive only

# DE 6.3 Key Concepts
- Metastore - Top level. Represents metadata. Different from hive metastore
	- Storage Credential
	- External Location
	- Catalog
		- Schema
			- Table
			- View
			- Function
	- Share
	- Recipient
