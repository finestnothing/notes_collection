# DE 6.5 Unity Catalog Identities

## User

A user is an individual user of the system
Authenticate with email and password
Interact through UI, cmd line, and API's
Identified by email addresses
Carry: first and last name (at minimum)

### Identities

Identities are the actual representation of users/admins/principals in databricks

## Admin

Manage and assign metastores and other users
Initial admin is made when setting up catalog, more can be toggled when making them

## Service Principal

Individual identity for use with tools and applications
Referred to by a creator-specified name, or a GUID (global user ID) which is assigned when it is created
Use an access token, access functionality through the api
Can be elevated to admin privileges
	Lets a program do admin-related activities, including managing users

## Groups

Users and Service Principals can be added to groups
Any rules given to the group automatically applies to all members of the group
Groups can be nested within other groups
- all_users (group)
	- analysts (group)
		- App 2
		- User 1
		- User 2
	- developers (group)
		- app 1
		- user 3
		- User 4

Each workspace can have variations on identities (called workspace identity) that map to a single account identity
- Account 1
	- workspace 1 account 1 - 777 (read write execute linux format)
	- workspace 2 account 1 - 700
