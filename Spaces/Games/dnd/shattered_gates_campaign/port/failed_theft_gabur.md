# failed_theft_gabur

- Gabur was Previously an ally, breaking into houses together
- Robbed a wealthy merchant, they were tasked with carrying the loot while I secured the way out.
	- After climbing down from the window, they set the pack down - loudly - to rest, a guard heard and we had to run - the idiot left the pack there
- I said they were an idiot - which they absolutely are - and told them to never come near me again or I would turn them in to the merchant
	- I haven't seen them since
