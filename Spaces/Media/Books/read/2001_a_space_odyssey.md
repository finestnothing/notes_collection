# 2001: A Space Odyssey

## By Arthur C. Clarke

### Notes

- Interesting introduction
- Good so far, definitely see why it's been liked
- Supposed to be heavy on the tech side (explaining it, etc)

### Final Thoughts

- This was a *really* good book, I see why it's so popular
- It didn't have anything that was heart pounding action, it was more tech-focused and mystery
- Slightly horror when the AI - Hal - refused to let the people have control and killed them in pursuit of it's own goal
- Very cool ending idea, he made it but they won't know where he went
- Became one of the advanced beings that left the obelisks the whole time, now functions as a type of actual god over Earth
