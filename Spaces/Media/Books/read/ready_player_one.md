# Ready Player One

## By Ernest Cline

### Review:

Beginning - A lot darker and grittier than the movie, but the same general concept, very well written already though. I think I'll like it a lot.
Middle - Continuing previous review, it's a lot darker and more in-depth than the movie, but so much better. Still loving every bit of it.
Middle - Still loving it all
End - Finished it today. It was awesome right through the end even though it was very different than the movie.

Sequel: [ready_player_two](ready_player_two.md)
