# Ready Player Two

## By Ernest Cline

### Review:

Start - Finished [ready_player_one](ready_player_one.md) today, started ready player two
Middle - It's been a lot sadder than the original book, but it is very interesting. I look forward to reading more of it.
End - Finished, overall it was alright but it wasn't as great as I wanted. It got pretty dumb when Anoraks AI took over to be honest.

Sequel to: [[ready_player_one]]
