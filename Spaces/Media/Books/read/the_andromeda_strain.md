# The Andromeda Strain

## By Michael #Crichton

### Final Thoughts

It was a good book. It wasn't thrilling and the most "exciting" part was a mad dash to press a button at the end.
That said, it was very interesting having them go through their program, trying to deal with the virus, then the twist of them not having to actually do anything.
Very well written book!
