Life is full of holes.

Even in the best of times, the span of one's years is never a perfect tapestry. laid out in a sprawl of days, months, and years, all woven in flawles detail. each color as bright as when its thread was plaited into the whole. Instead, over time, bits of this tapestry get worn away by age. Other sections stretch out of shape as one worries over them, returning again and again to pull and tug at certain threads. Worst of all, large pieces go threadbare, to the point of indecipherability. Still, memory proves to be a devious trickster-filling in gaps, darning rips, patching gaps-often with stories that are not true, only necessary. They are the yarn needed to create a whole that one can live with
