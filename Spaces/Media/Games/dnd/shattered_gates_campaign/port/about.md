# about

- Chaotic neutral
- Male
- Red eyes
- 40 lbs
- 3' tall
- Bald
- Burnt Orange skin
- Age 12 (adult)

- Often dressed in loose black clothes with a hood, a lighter gray mask that I pull over my face in public
- What would your character be willing to do for a cat stuck in a tree?
	- Say "Hey, cat! Get down here!", shrug, and walk away
	- Defensively justify to the cat why you can't save it right now as it watches you with anxious disinterest
	- Sit and watch the cat until it gets down on it's own, feel relieved that it all worked out
- People I would like
	- Gnome Bard
		- What up witches? If you want to party with me you have to dance - no exception!
		- I might seem picky but I'm actually very open-minded.
		- I may have grown up in the country, but I live for the city.
		- I do lutes, flutes, drums, violins, trumpets, but NEVER trombones (don't ask)
	- My ideal part is an eclectic group of surrogate family members who insist that they work alone while welcoming me into their lives
	- Halfling Rogue
		- I gotta find a party that understands boundaries.
		- If something goes missing in camp, maybe don't immediately go looking through my stuff? This should not be hard to do.
		- Everyone wants a swift blade in the dark and a careful ear at the fire, but no one wants to trust a halfling around their packs.
		- Message me if you're willing to trust
	- Human Warlock
		- Yes, I made a part with a dark god for untold power.
		- I was young. I was dumb. I get it.
		- There is more to me than that.
		- I'm looking for a party that will accept me for who I am and not wase everyone's time by trying to convert me or separate me from my dark master.
		- I want to be around people who aren't afraid of the grisly fates suffered by those who used to travel with me.
		- I'm pretty sure that was just a very specific series of coincidences.
		- Pure of heart only
- What keeps me fighting
	- "You are at deaths door. Your breath is shallow and ragged. Your joints cry and ache. Every physical part of you longs to lie down and rest, come what may."
	- I see my parents, desperately helping me out the back of our house even though they couldn't follow, saving my life, driven.
	- I reach for my stone when I need comfort or to figure out a difficult problem.
