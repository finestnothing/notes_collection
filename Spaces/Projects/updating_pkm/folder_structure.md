# folder_structure

Created: 20221222 14:37

## Requirements

- [ ] Easy to access maps of content for diving into topics
	- Maybe genre-wide maps of content for entering, that connect to sub-topics
		- Would make it easier to avoid the folder structure'
- [x] Cards Folder ✅ 2023-02-08
	- Need a location for the content itself
- [x] Simple way/place to add any new content ✅ 2023-02-08
	- I don't want to have to think about where a new note will go immediately
- [x] README file ✅ 2023-02-08
	- Introduction to the PKM
	- Links to the maps of content genres (or the maps themselves)
- [x] Utilities ✅ 2023-02-08
	- Need a place to put utility files
	- Includes documentation, templates, intro-files, etc
- [x] Some sort of workflow for raw -> cleaned -> atomic ✅ 2023-02-08
	- Look into evergreen maybe?
	- Something like andy matsuchacks notes

Try to figure out how [About these notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) set up their notes
	Evergreen setup would be cool
	Brian Jenks setup looks promising [INDEX - Petrichor - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/bryan-jenks/Z/INDEX)

Will want to be more particular about what becomes final content
	Some stuff is so I don't need to google later
	Other stuff can be for putting together writing
