## DE 3.1 - Schemas and Tables

### Managed (internal) tables

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ${da.db_name}_default_location; -- New schema in default location
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ${da.db_name}_custom_location LOCATION '${da.paths.working_dir}/_custom_location.db'; -- new schema in custom location
```
Schema is a logical database object holder
Formally describing a database system
A set of formulas called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema

```sql
describe schema extended ${da.db_name}_default_location;
describe schema extended ${da.db_name}_custom_location;
```
Says info about both schemas
Default location is dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse/

```sql
use ${da.db_name}_default_location;

create or replace table managed_table_in_db_default_location (
	width INT,
	length INT,
	height INT
); -- Create table at default locatiion

insert into manage_table_in_db_default_location
values(3, 2, 1); -- Insert values

select * from managed_table_in_db_default_location; -- Get data from it
```
By default, tables are created in dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse/{schema_name}.db
	Metadata and such goes there

### Unmanaged (external) tables
Creates a table from a data source such as a csv file

```sql
use ${da.db_name}_default_location;

create or replace temporary view temp_delays using csv options(
	path = "dbfs:/{path_to_csv}",
	header = "true",
	mode = "FAILFAST" -- Abort file parsing with a runtimeexception if any malformed rows
);
creaste or replace table external_table location '${da.paths.working_dir}/external_table' as
	select * from temp_delays;

select * from external tables -- display table
```
Creates table from file

## DE 3.2 - Version and Optimize Delta Tables
Stuff unique to delta lake

### Compacting Small Files and Indexing

```sql
optimize students
zorder by id
```
Optimize {table} 
	Files get combined toward an optimal size 
	Replace existing data files by combining records and rewriting the results
zorder by {id} - Indexes table
	Speeds up data retrieval while filtering on provided fields by storing data with similar values near eachother

Must be done together
Optimize creates a different version of the table

```sql
describe history {table}
```
Show different versions of our tables 

```sql
select *
from students version as of 3
```
Time travel query (see describe history to find history)
Does *not* undo the table from it's current version

```sql
vacuum students retain 0 hours
```
Manually purges all  version histories (databricks also does it automatically)
Deletes all related files that are older than 7 days old

## Done for today, DE 3.3 is next
