## What is Databricks SQL Training

### Objectives
- Data analysis workflows, extract and share insights
- tools and features
- Fundamental Concepts for using databricks sql

Dashboarding view to display the data
Some exploratory stuff, dashboards, etc
Can use external BI tools - Tableau, Power BI, etc
Path through JDBC drivers
SQL endpoints share resources to give quick queries
Spark is backend for queries
Photon - Vectorized query engine, takes advantage of modern CPU's for parallelization
Queries run on the Delta lake directly
Will be working with spark a lot (sql for making the queries though)
Need SQL endpoint, SQL catalog, and database to query (setup by DB admin)
2 types of end points
- Traditional - in your own cloud account
- Serverless - Live in databricks cloud. Faster launch times than traditional
Catalog is first of 3 layers of unity catalog namespace
	Catalogs hold databases
Database is next layer of unity catalog namespace
Can star queries to view saved queries on homepage
Dashboard page for managing dashboards
Alerts page for sending a notification when a query reaches some criteria
Query history - History of all queries
Partner connect - connect external tools

- Catalogs are held in the schema browser. Hive metastore is the catalog we have now
- Click 3 dots menu on saved query, you can share queries with people or groups

- Automate workflows
	- Set up notification if values fall out of certain ranges to make sure things are within criteria
	- Auto schedule refreshes to queries
	- When visualizations are saved, they will always pop up when you open that query
- Dashboards
	- Annotate text in the dashboard using markdown calls
	- Add visualizations to the dashboard
