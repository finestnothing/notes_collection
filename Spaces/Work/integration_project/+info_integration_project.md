# Standard Integration Project

Project home for integration project.
The goal is to send data to clients through a series of step functions with logging along the way.

Technically [[solutions_engineering]], not data engineering

Need to make it more modular
- Each step function can be run or not in any order specific to each integration_id
- Stick them together like legoes instead of single linear path
