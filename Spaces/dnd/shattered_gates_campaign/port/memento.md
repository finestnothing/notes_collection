- I could hold it in my hand and feel pride
- It was specifically crafted for me with love
- A one intricately carved smooth stone, the carvings now barely visible
- Intricate but rather ugly carving, seemingly done at random. Can almost make out a face
- Keep it with me
- Given to me by my parents as a gift before I can remember
	- Found wandering alone on the outskirts of Eltania with just the stone and my clothes
