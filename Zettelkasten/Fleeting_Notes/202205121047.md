intro to kubernetes

Kubernetes is open source and uses apache 2 license.
Created by google, based on their Borg and Omega programs which are similar but handle all of their services.

Kubernetes handles all the scheduling and scaling for multiple applications.
It treats all the available hardware (storage, processing power, etc) as a pool of available resources. 
As a container needs more or less, it's scaled accordingly.
For example, when a website is busy (say 9-5), kubernetes would expand the processing power of the website to accommodate more connections without slowing down or crashing.
When it is slower, it will free up resources that can then be allocated to another website or app that is running as they need it.

Compatible with docker, containerd, and many others through abstraction.
Containerd is a stripped down version of docker and is lighter weight for better performance in Kubernetes.
