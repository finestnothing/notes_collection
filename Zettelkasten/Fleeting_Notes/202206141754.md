		- Applies best to laundry.
		- When considering different wash/dry times:
			- Normal wash and normal dry time - Anywhere in schedule
			- Longer wash time, normal dry time (very dirty) - Put at the end of the schedule
			- Normal wash time, longer dry time (large load) - Put at the beginning of the schedule
		- With 2 machine steps: if shorter step is on second machine, schedule it last. If shorter step is on first machine, schedule it first
	- Useful for laundry, but most things are single-machine problems (with you being the single-machine)
