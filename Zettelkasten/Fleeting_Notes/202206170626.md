2: Do you need a Stop Doing List?
If you’re feeling like you’re not making meaningful progress toward a goal, or if your day is just filled with more distractions than it should be, then perhaps you need a “Stop Doing” list.

What is getting in your way from the results you want?

If it’s things within your control, can you stop doing them?

Some examples:

Stop unlocking my iPhone before 8:30 am.
Stop bringing my iPhone into the office.
Stop checking my email when I’m bored.
Stop eating snacks after 7:30 pm.
Stop checking social media before lunchtime.
Stop spending money on such-and-such category.
Stop … ?

What would you put onto your stop-doing list?
