Chapter 4 - Caching

- Main helpful point is that it's very efficient to put the last accessed thing at the top of a pile
- Far faster than putting it back in it's place initially, and you are likely to need that thing again so it will be at (or near) the top of the stack/first place you look in the future.
- Started using this for obsidian notes, with the last modified files higher up in the hierarchy rather than alphabetical
