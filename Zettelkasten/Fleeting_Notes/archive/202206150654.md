	- Shortest Processing Time algorithm
		- Do the shortest tasks firsts
		- This reduces the total wait time
			- E.G. A 4 day project and a 1 day project. If you do the 4 day one and turn it in Thursday and the 1 day one turned in Friday, the clients have waited a total of 4+5 days total. If you do the 1 day project first, they wait a total of 1+5 days.
		- It doesn't change the total time, but reduces the total waiting
			- Also called the sum of completion times
	- Doing the shortest/fastest things first also reduces the total number of things that you has to do, which often helps you relax more
	- When paying off debt, you should either pay off the lowest debts first, or the largest. Lowest debts will reduce the separate numbers of debts, largest debts will reduce anxiety about the highest ones

	- Pre-crastination
		- In a 2014 study by David Rosenbaum
			- participants were asked to move one of two heavy buckets to the end of the hall. One bucket right next to them, one already part way down the hall
			- Nearly all of the participants immediately picked up the one next to them even though it was more work
		- They saw "pick up a bucket" as a subgoal and fulfilled it immediately to get that task done, even though it was more difficult
	- Pro-crastination
		- It's not laziness or avoidance. It is often just working on the *number* of tasks to be completed rather than the size, even if the other tasks they do are trivial
		- Not a bad strategy, just a good one for the wrong metric

	- 1997, Mars Rover scheduling
	- Bug in the scheduling program
	- A low priority task was being interrupted while working on a database which tied up the database, and a high priority task (move data in/out of it's information bus) wasn't getting done
	- The high priority task needed the database that was held up by the low priority task, but the low priority task wasn't being done because there were a lot of medium priority tasks being done instead
	- This made them lose several days of data and work
	- The solution was priority inheritance
		- If a lower priority task was holding up a higher priority task, the lower priority task would temporarily be promoted (until the higher priority task was complete)
	- The irony of this was that the bug was known but not addressed due to deadline pressures before the launch. They said this issue was deemed a lower priority.
	- Being driven to get a number of things done isn't infallible, but neither is being driven to get important things done

	- If you have multiple tasks that are all handled in a similar way or at the same place, try to group them together
		- E.G. If you have 5 bills that come in through the month and they all give you 30 days to pay, pick one day a month to sit down and pay all of them at once
		- E.G. If you frequently have multiple errands to run downtown that come up through the day, do them all in a row after the last one of the day comes in.
