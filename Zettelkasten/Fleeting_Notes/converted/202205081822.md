Some companies plan to reach the highest they can as fast as possible, Others take their time and grow slowly

Even with bootstrap approaches, there are still people who push "the hustle" to drive hard to finish products etc

Should putter, be a part of the whole process, and most importantly, have fun with it, like gardening

Doing it for the fun of it and to view it as a person and not just numbers on a spreadsheet is important, and connecting with users is fulfilling and helpful

To continue a project, it has to meet basic minimum viability (income vs cost, etc). This depends on your own needs and means. Once it reaches this, you continue to putter with it and enjoy it, both for yourself and for the user base.

This is my garden, and I intend to putter.
