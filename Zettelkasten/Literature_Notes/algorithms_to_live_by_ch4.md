- It is more efficient to put things into a sorting system as they are last accessed/changed/used
- Example is a pile of papers, most recently used things on top
- Faster to sort because you just put it on top, but also faster to access frequently used info moving forward because it will already be at the top rather than having to sort through the system
- I switched my obsidian notes over to sorting by last modified
	- A day later, it's pretty nice and I'm going to keep it
