- Laplaces Law
	- Used to estimate probabilities of events
	- Formula is (w+1)/(n+2)
		- E.G. if you buy 10 raffle tickets and win 7 of them, you can estimate that there is an 8/12 tickets are winning tickets overall
	- Works well for both small data (1 data point, either 1/3 or 2/3), or extremely large amounts of data
- Copernican Principle
	- Often times, people see themselves as the center of everything, and judge how long something will exist by when they encountered it
		- E.G. Seeing the berlin wall after 8 years, saying it will stand for 8 more (not 20)
	- Obvious exceptions to this such as you wouldn't assume a 6 year old would die at 12 or 90 year old at 180, but the generalization happens more often than expected
