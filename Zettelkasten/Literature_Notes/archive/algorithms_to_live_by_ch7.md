- Regularization is a way to reduce overfitting
- Overfitting is when we use too much data (or too many aspects of it) to draw a conclusion, and it no longer fits in terms of prediction, just recall of the training data
	- If we try to fit the data to 3 points too much, we will get a parabola shape rather than a straight line. If we try to fit it to 4 points, it may end up as a trinomial rather than straight line, etc
- Regularization is the process of driving the factors that don't matter to zero so they no longer matter, but leaving the important aspects to actually aid in prediction
	- Useful in machine learning and statistics, but also good to keep in mind for removing extraneous information in real life
- If you have a high uncertainty about your data, and not much of it, stop early!
	- Leave ideas as an overarching idea rather than trying to flesh out details 
	- E.G. Sketching with a wide sharpie rather than a pencil, leaving the fine details for later
- If you have low uncertainty and a lot of data, keep refining the idea!
	- Try to get as specific as possible - but still not overly so. There is always a good point to stop
	- E.G. Doing a construction drawing in pen or pencil, not just drawing the walls
