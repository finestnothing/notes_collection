# My Product is My Garden
Created: 2022-06-06 10:48

While most companies, especially as the number of employees and users increases, pursue growth, it is perfectly okay to take your time developing a product and not rush development just to get it released.

Even when building a product from the ground up, there are always people that are pushing to already get it finished as soon as possible rather than taking time to do it well and be happy with the product.

The essence of puttering in a project is to become familiar with the whole aspect, and slowly build it up in a fun way rather than rushing. It is akin to gardening, nurturing the product slowly and enjoying the growing process.

To grow a project past a certain point, the income, need for it, or any other benefit from the project must outweigh the cost and time commitment to it.
If a project is losing money to maintain or taking too much time away from more profitable or fun projects, it is okay to stop working on it.
If a project meets this though, you can and should continue to putter on it! This is beneficial to you since you have somewhere to putter and explore on a project, and to the user base who will also enjoy the new content as you make it.

This is my garden, and I intend to putter.
