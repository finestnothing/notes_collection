# how_to_apply_37_percent_rule
Created: 2022-06-16 08:56

- The 37% rule can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, but it is particular to a specific kind
- It is best for problems where you have to immediately accept an option, or have it be lost
	- It can also be applied to cases where you can go back but you have too many options to observe all of them
- E.G. Picking a secretary. Say that you have 100 secretaries lined up for interviews. In each interview, you either hire them and immediately stop searching, or turn them away and they get hired elsewhere and are no longer an option. The 37% rule says that you should interview the first 37 with no intention of hiring them. After this data gathering phase, you should then immediately hire the next "best" secretary that you interview
- If you are able to rank your choices using percentiles, then the threshold rule also comes into effect. (E.G. ranking secretaries based on typing speed)
- If none in the exploratory phase exceed the percentile needs, then still follow the 37% rule (and obviously if someone now exceeds the threshold, they would obviously be the best)
