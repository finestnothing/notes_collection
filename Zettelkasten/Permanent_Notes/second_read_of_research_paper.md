- This pass will take significantly longer than the first pass, up to about an hour
- Meant to get you to understand the content and be able to summarize it, even if you wouldn't be able to write a paper on the same topic.
- What to do on this pass:
	- Read the paper from start to finish, avoiding proofs or sections that require deep-understanding. You don't need to be an expert in it this pass, the results of the proofs is fine.
	- Write down key points and comments as you read
		- In the margin, or on a separate sheet referencing the location of notes. This helps keep track of the major ideas in each section and of the paper as a whole.
	- Check all visuals for accuracy
		- Check labelling and scaling
		- Are they relevant? Skewed?
	- Make a list of references that you haven't read yet. This makes it easier to go back and read relevant texts if needed (or just for later reading)
- After this pass:
	- If you don't understand the topic still, that's alright! It could be due to: 
		- The author (writing the paper badly or incorrectly)
		- Your knowledge base not being where it needs to be to understand it (required base knowledge, the proofs are important, etc)
		- You could simply be tired and need to look at it again when you're awake and less distracted
	- If you have any issues with the paper (above) but determine that it's still relevant, you can re-do the second pass to get a better understanding or go to the third pass
