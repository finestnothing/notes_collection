Created: 2022-06-16 09:03

- Using the table below, immediately hire someone/pick an option (even in exploratory phase) if they exceed the percentile threshold. As you get to fewer and fewer options, the threshold decreases because you are less and less likely to get someone that exceeds it.
	- Remaining: 25, pick from 98th percentile
	- Remaining 10: Pick from 90th percentile
	- Remaining 5: pick from 85th percentile
	- Remaining 4: pick from 78th percentile
	- Remaining 3: pick from 69th percentile
	- Remaining 2: Pick from 50th percentile
