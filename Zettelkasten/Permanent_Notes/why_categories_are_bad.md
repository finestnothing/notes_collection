# why_categories_are_bad
Created: 2022-06-09 08:15

- If you make categories for your notes, it ultimately slows you down. 
- You have to know where to drop information, and if you are researching a topic that goes across multiple categories you will either have way too much information, or miss information that is related, but in a different category.
- If new info doesn't match a category well, it will either be put into a category that it doesn't fit well and will not be referenced in the future, or will form it's own niche category/folder that makes your notes more convoluted
