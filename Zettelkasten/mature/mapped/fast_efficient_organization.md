- The optimal way to sort (files, books, clothes, etc) is to put most recently used on the top/left/etc
- This makes it so the most likely things to be accessed (the most recently used) are at or near the top, rather than having to dig through the entire pile
- If you have to access everything equally then a standard sorting is ideal, but normally some items are used far more than others
