- Gittins Index is used to tell the probability of a payoff or win
- It ranks choices based on past performance, both wins and losses (or good experiences and bad, etc) on a table
- An entirely untested option (0 tests) is ranked at around 0.7, so if the index for an option drops below that, it's time to explore new options!
