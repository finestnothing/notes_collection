# goals_of_blog_content
Created: 2022-09-29 18:29

- The content should be fun for me to make, but also fun and useful for others to read
- Create a sense of community
	- Not everything has to be just people reading my stuff
	- Comment sections are good for [[customizing_a_blog]] and to let the community participate a bit
- Try to release content at least weekly.
	- More often is better, but too little will lead to people forgetting about it or not wanting to read
	- If only once or twice a week, try to stick to a schedule of releasing to keep consistent readers
- Treat each post like an essay
	- Descriptive non-clickbait title - [[post_titles_are_imporant]]!
	- Start with an intro or at least a small hook. Reading something without one can be hard to get people into it
