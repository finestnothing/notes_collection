To work on Zettelkasten, there will be a lot of growing pains at first - just like a newborn learning, or learning a new language. This is fine, because it grows and morphs according to you, if you let it.

You treat your Zettelkasten like you learn. You collect information [[fleeting_notes]], then you digest it at a later time [[literature_notes]]. Finally, you connect the digested information [[literature_notes]] to other related information in [[permanent_notes]] and [[content_maps]].

As you get more information, you can grow your "web", either stemming from each [[content_maps]] directly, or they can branch out and more resemble a spider web as notes connect to each other. Zettelkastens are not supposed to be dropped into categories, just organically grown around topics and ideas (see [[why_categories_are_bad]])
