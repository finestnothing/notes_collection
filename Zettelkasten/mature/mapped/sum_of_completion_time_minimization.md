- If all tasks are weighted the same/equal, you should do shorter tasks first
	- Tasks being weighted the same means same due date, no pressing concerns on any of them, etc
- If you have a 4 day project and a 1 day project, do the 1 day one first.
	- If 1 day project done first, the total wait time for both projects is 1 day + 5 days
	- If 4 day project is done first, the total wait time is 4 days + 5 days
- This also reduces the number of tasks faster, so you do less task-switching later when you need to focus
