# Using Zettelkasten

1. Take notes on something in fleeting notes (seedlings)
	- These should not be in-depth notes, just the overall ideas that I think I want to explore more later
		- Okay to make them in-depth, but leave room for later interpretation
	- Okay to just use zettelkasten titling
	- Only meant to be temporary, can be deleted after being converted
2. At the end of the day/week/month/whenever I have time/tuesdays, go through all seedlings to create sprouts
	- Literature notes expand on the ideas from the fleeting notes, but it is okay to drop ideas that you no longer see as useful or helpful!
	- Literature notes still need the context of the original source in most cases
	- Should only rephrase ideas, not copy/paste them. Make them relevant to ME not the author
		- These should be my thoughts and ideas on the topics from the seedlings
	- Keep the title of the source, to make it easier to reference
	- Keep these literature notes! Even if just as an archive, it can be useful to go back and revisit while doing later research
3. Eventually, go through sprouts to create mature notes
	- These will never get deleted, but it is okay to edit, add, and change them if you get more related content
	- Multiple permanent notes can come from one literature note and be linked together
		- Example: What is bootstrapping and Benefits of bootstrapping as different notes that are linked together
4. Make gardens for each major topic that refence relevant mature notes
