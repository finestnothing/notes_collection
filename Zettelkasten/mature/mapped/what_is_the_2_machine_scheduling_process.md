- This sorting process is applied when you have 2 "machine" or processes to achieve for each item.
- Example include laundry (washing then drying), book making (binding and sealing), etc
- If the first of two steps is longer, put the task at the end of the schedule
- If the second of two steps takes longer, put the task at the beginning of the schedule
