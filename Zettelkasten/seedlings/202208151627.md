- What
	- Critical part of lake house ([[202208151627#^be68fe|Reference 2]]) architecture 
	- Enables robustness, speed, versioning, and data-warehouse like stability 
	- Also a cheap blob service
- Databricks built in support
- Data pipelines
	- Should follow multi-tiered approach including progressive cleaning and transformation
		- Bronze - raw data ingest. Mirrors data source.
		- Silver - semi-processed, usable for ML and data science
		- Gold - highly processed, usable for BI reports
		- More info on 3 tier process in [[202208151627#^de1249|Reference 3]]
- Delta live tables
	- Framework for making data processing pipelines
	- Define transformations, delta live table then manages the tasks, cluster management, monitoring, data quality, and error handling
