- Don't By Spooky
- Sending a message of just "hello" or "Got a minute?" with no context is bad for anxiety
- Especially bad at the beginning or end of a meeting
- Even if it's not for something bad, the other person doesn't know that
- Pings and repeated messages are the same way - if I didn't have time an hour ago, I probably don't have time now either
- Don't send "hello" before drafting the real message, send the hello with the rest of the message
	- Keep all relevant messages in one bigger message
