- A lot of internet startup subcultures
	- bootstrappers
	- vc-backed tech-bros
	- crypto investors
	- marketing courses about marketing courses
	- newsletter gurus
	- micro-saas homeboys
- Bootstrapping was popularised by the IndieHackers movement
- There are plenty of people that hustle their apps or courses so they make a lot of money or spend all their time working to try to not have to work in the future
- New analogy/ideology - My product is my garden
	- Plants require nurturing, weeding, watering, puttering about the garden
	- Requires research and reading articles
	- What grows well with other plants
- The analogy can work with products
- Putter about, connect with all parts of the process, and have *fun* doing it
	- A product you like spending time on because making it is enjoyable
- Once you have a product or products help you meet basic profitability alone, you can focus on them even more and enjoy it full time if you want
	- You shouldn't focus on them full time just to grow for the sake of growing, but to ensure that the people using the tools you make keep having a better and better experience with them
- "This is my garden, and I intend to putter."
