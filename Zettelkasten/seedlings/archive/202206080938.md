Don't prepare or invent categories, just start writing

Creating categories is often a top-down approach, where you design everything then drop things into boxes. If notes don't fit in somewhere nicely, they'll fit into somewhere badly which defeats the purpose, or require a whole new category.

Zettelkasten is more tied to how your brain works, not specific categories. The more closely it matches, the better your system.
In a brain, we don't make categories to fit knowledge into, we obtain knowledge and link it together.

Empty slate: You collect information, and make sense/categorize/digest it later. If it's connected to other information, then you will understand it sooner.
Assimilation: As you get new information, it augments existing information.

Grow information like a web, add on to the base knowledge and how it connects.

Premade categories are rigid, not meant for growth

To make your KMS map like your brain, collect notes and let the connections grow organically

topic clusters emerge from keywords to show how they fit together 

Meant to be highly personalized to how each person thinks
