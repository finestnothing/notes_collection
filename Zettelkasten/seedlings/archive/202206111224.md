	- Threshold rule can also be used with 37% rule
	- If an applicant/option is above a certain threshhold, immediately accept it even if you are in the observation phase
		- Make the threshold so you are confident that you will not find someone better in your pool
	- 95% percentile, for example, but it is context dependent
	- Helpful thresholds:
		- Remaining: 25, pick from 98th percentile
		- Remaining 10: Pick from 90th percentile
		- Remaining 5: pick from 85th percentile
		- Remaining 4: pick from 78th percentile
		- Remaining 3: pick from 69th percentile
		- Remaining 2: Pick from 50th percentile
- Page 25 - Optimal Stopping for parking spaces
	- Follow this table for finding first free spot to take
	- Occ % is how full the area is, spaces from dest is how far to start looking for spaces (while going towards destination)
		- Occ%: 0 spaces from dest: 0
		- Occ%: 50 spaces from dest: 1
		- Occ%: 75 spaces from dest: 3
		- Occ%: 80 spaces from dest: 4
		- Occ%: 85 spaces from dest: 5
		- Occ%: 90 spaces from dest: 7
		- Occ%: 95spaces from dest: 14
		- Occ%: 96 spaces from dest: 17
		- Occ%: 97 spaces from dest: 23
		- Occ%: 98 spaces from dest: 35
		- Occ%: 99 spaces from dest: 69
		- Occ%: 99.9 spaces from dest: 693
		- E.G. if parking is approximately 90% full, take the first free spot you see starting 7 parking spots away from your destination. If 95% full, take the first free spot 14 spaces from dest.
- Page 27 - Quit while you're ahead
	- In a problem where you can make gains, but have a chance to lose everything, simple algo for how many to attempt (for example, robberies)
	- Success percentage/Lose percentage
		- If you have 90% success chance (10% chance to lose it all), you should stop after 90/10=9 attempts
		- With 50% success chance, stop after 50/50=1 (nothing to lose first time, but likely to lose the second time and on)
