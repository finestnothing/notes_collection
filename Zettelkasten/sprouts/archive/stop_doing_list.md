- Rather than just a list of things to do, make a list of things to stop doing to improve efficiency
- Fill the list with distractions, either things that often pop up but can be done later, or things that aren't important
- Examples:
	- stop unlocking phone before 8:00 AM
	- Don't check phone when bored
	- Don't snack after 8:00 PM
	- Don't check social media before Noon
	- Don't buy anything for entertainment
	- Stop making excuses to not do something
