## Autolyze
- After mixing the ingredients for dough together, it needs to rest
- Mix ingredients together without kneading, then leave in a bowl
- Letting it rest before kneading it allows the gluten development to get started uninterrupted
- Takes 15 - 60 minutes
	- The longer the better
	- At least 30 minutes for Sourdough
- After the 30 minutes are up, then you can knead the dough then let it riser
## Rising Time
- Make sure room temp is around 68-70 Fahrenheit while rising to let the sourdough starter work on the gluten without being slowed by the cold
	- Should only use bubbly and active sourdough starter, otherwise you have to wait for it become active as well as letting it rise.
- It will take between 3 and 12 hours to rise
	- Depends on rising agent
		- Yeast is usually faster, but without the flavor of sourdough
		- Sourdough is slower, but more flavorful.
			- Some starters will also rise faster or slower than others
	- Important thing is that it will be roughly doubled in volume when it is done - this is more important than the time it takes!
## Strengthening the dough
- Strengthening the dough has a major advantage even though it is more work - it helps the gluten be stronger, leading to a better rise!
### Stretch and fold
- Stretching and folding the dough is how to strengthen the gluten
- Should be done about 30 minutes into the rising time
- Grab the top of the dough
	- Pull/stretch it up a decent way, then push/fold it back down near the middle of the dough
	- Rotate 90 degrees and repeat until a full rotation has been completed
- Can be repeated every hour during the rise phase for even better gluten
