	- Content ^5d17fb
		- Can make things as formal or informal as I want
		- Talk about things I like, tutorials, standards, etc
		- Passion about what I'm writing is important
			- Not doing it for the money, just for my own joy
			- I should treat it like a garden (later ref to product as a garden)
		- Create a sense of community
			- Make a comments section, talk to the readers directly (if I get any), etc
		- Try to release weekly content at least, to keep any visitors engaged
		- Advice
			- Descriptive title
				- Don't clickbait it, make it actually helpful and interesting
			- Treat it like an essay. Start with an intro/hook! Draw in readers, and get fun with it
			- Table of contents is everyone's best friend
			- Include any relevant photos
				- I hate stock photos though

				- If I use markdown/obsidian that will be easy
