# PKM Tags
Confused about what tags to use when? Needing to know what tags some default files should fall under?
Look no further!

- #to/ - A collection of tags that require an action as followup
	- #to/do - Tasks to follow up on at a later time
	- #to/research - Something to look into at a later time. Either add it to the PKM and integrate the link, or ignore it.
