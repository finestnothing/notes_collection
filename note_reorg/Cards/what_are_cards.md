Cards are the core of my PKM system.
In terms of zettelkasten notes, they are the permanent notes, but with a broader definition.
A card in my PKM system is any bit of atomic knowledge, and should be linked to other relevant cards or ideas (even if the file doesn't exist yet).

As a more concrete definition, a card is a single idea or statement on a topic or thing.
