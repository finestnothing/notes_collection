# Planning Notes
These notes aren't regarding planning at all, rather they are the "Planning" portion of the card lifecycle!
The notes in this folder are essentially raw data. They can be any tidbit of information, notes from a source, random ideas, or anything else that isn't developed into my own words or ideas yet.

Planning notes eventually turn into [[+about_dev|dev notes]] by writing the information into full ideas and expanding on them, thereby "developing" them.
